# MelonSmash
A different kind of tower defense Unity game as a group of 6 students. The game features a farmer trying to protect his precious pumpkin by throwing different types of melons - one to deal damage and other to lure the enemies. The enemies are vermin which spawn in waves with increasing difficulty. We still are working on improving the game and adding new mechanics to it.
